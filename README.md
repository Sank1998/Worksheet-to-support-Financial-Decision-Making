Project Title: Cash Flow Forecast Worksheet for Financial Decision Making

Project Overview:

The project aimed to design, create, and test a comprehensive cash flow forecast worksheet for a small computer manufacturing company. The worksheet was tailored to support what-if questioning, enabling the company to evaluate the impact of various business scenarios, such as a sudden increase in component costs or a shift in sales forecasts.

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Data Acquisition: Utilized the provided database file to import all relevant financial data into Excel.

Data Cleaning: Employed data cleansing techniques to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the imported data:
a. Blank or Zero Value Removal: Identified and eliminated rows containing empty cells or zero values, as they held no meaningful information for the cash flow forecast.

b. Whitespace Removal: Removed any extraneous double, leading, or trailing whitespace from the data to maintain data integrity and enhance readability.

c. Street Data Expansion and Correction: Expanded all abbreviations or inconsistencies in the "Street" data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

d. Gender Correction: Corrected all gender entries to adhere to the standard coding ("M" for male and "F" for female) to ensure accurate data representation.

e. Duplicate Record Removal: Identified and removed any duplicate records from the dataset to eliminate redundancies and ensure data integrity.

Design and Development:

User-Friendly Layout: Designed the worksheet interface to be clear, uncluttered, and intuitive for the target user, an experienced manager with limited spreadsheet expertise.

User Form Implementation: Created a user form to enhance the worksheet's interactivity and provide additional functionality:
a. Input Fields for What-if Scenarios: Incorporated input fields within the user form to allow users to input various parameters, such as changes in component costs or sales forecasts.

b. Dynamic Updates: Dynamically updated the cash flow forecast calculations based on the values entered in the user form's input fields. This enabled real-time what-if analysis without the need for manual calculations.

Data Integrity Enforcement: Employed cell protection, data validation, and conditional formatting to safeguard data integrity and provide visual cues to the user:
a. Cell Protection: Protected sensitive cells, such as input fields and key calculations, to prevent accidental modification.

b. Data Validation: Validated data entry to ensure it conformed to the specified data types and ranges, preventing invalid or erroneous entries.

c. Conditional Formatting: Employed conditional formatting to highlight cells based on specific conditions, such as negative values or potential outliers, to draw attention to potential issues.

VBA Programming for Automation and Enhancement: Leveraged VBA programming to automate tasks, handle user interactions, and extend the worksheet's functionality:
a. Macro Development: Developed macros to automate repetitive tasks, such as data input and calculations, saving time and effort for the user.
